Place the DFA input file into the same folder as the rest of the program files

Name the .txt file dfa

Compile and run the program

Enter your desired string for testing when prompted

The program reads the txt file and generates a graph data structure to traverse through. If the final
vertex is labeled as an accepting state, then the string is accepted. If the vertex is not an accepting
state then the string is not accepted.
